### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Taleb Bagazi a professional with 5 years of experience in Accounting and in last years has a double job as Data Analyst in Educational Technology. His double job and his background experience have provided him with a well-rounded background and enabled him to develop an analytical & logical approach to tasks, ability to understand problems, business statistics, forecasting skills and accustomed to seeing things based on data and metrics but still technology-based. As time goes by, he found himself loving to play with the large data and process it to make it simple for the audience to understand the problem using a dashboard and visualization. Thus, he joined Full stack Data Analyst RevoU to sharpen his skills in the business problem statement, Statistics and spreadsheets, SQL, Python, and Data Visualization using Google Data Studio and Tableau. He believes with his previous experience and his skills before and after joining the data analyst boot camp make best fit for the role of a data analyst or any position relevant to data.
